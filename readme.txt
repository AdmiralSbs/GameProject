List of lists format for processing:
    Each minor list in the major list contains the data for one column (x value)
    Each item in the minor list contains the data for one cell in that column
    For each item in the minor list, the y value increments
    For each minor list in the major list, the x value increments
    The filling goes from top to bottom, then from left to right
    Not every spot going down needs to be filled with data

So you want to mess around with it:
    Create or edit the map file
    Edit the dictionary
    Should work just fine
